# Basic Algorithms written in C++

This repo contains the codes of some basic algorithms written in C++. I'm writing these codes as part of an online course about algorithms.

I've been wanting to learn a lower-level computer language for quite some time, which is the reason I'm forcing myself to write in C++. (By the way, by "lower level" I mean lower level compared to Python, which I'm most familiar with.)

**Note:** I'm completely new to the world of C++, so any pointers (pun intended) are very much appreciated! So please, feel free to contact me: **kristian.holsheimer@gmail.com**.

* **merge_sort.cc**: This algorithm takes an unsorted list of *n* integers and returns its sorted version in *O*(*n* log *n*) time. As a perk, my implementation of the algorithm also keeps track of the *number of inversions* required.
